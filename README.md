## Hi! I'm Simon Anari!

I am working on becoming a professional in the Cybersecurity field.

This website will be where I post my projects or blog about my life.

```markdown
public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Here is how I will most likely explain my code for my projects. Very cool feature.");
    }
```

## Anyways, thank you for viewing this site and I will update it as much as I can!
